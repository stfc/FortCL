# FortCL

Fortran wrapper library providing OpenCL functionality.
It uses (and includes) the "clFortran" interface code
available from https://github.com/cass-support/clfortran.

# Compiling #

The Makefile picks-up the compiler, flags etc. from environment
variables. You will need to set F90 (and optionally, F90FLAGS).
